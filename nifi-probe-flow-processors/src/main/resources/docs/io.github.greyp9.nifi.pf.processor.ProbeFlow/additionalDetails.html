<h1>ProbeFlow Processor</h1>

<p>When used with the corresponding controller service, the ProbeFlow processor allows manual adjustment of the
    FlowFiles in a running NiFi flow. This processor enables the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accept Incoming FlowFile (from upstream NiFi connections)</li>
    <li>Create New FlowFile(s) (from adhoc text, from filesystem file, from previously persisted ProbeFlow processor
        state)
    </li>
    <li>Edit Existing FlowFile</li>
    <li>View Processor State</li>
    <li>Custom Routing of Outgoing FlowFile</li>
</ul>

<p>When not running, this processor is inert. It will not accept FlowFiles, nor will any FlowFiles be routed to any
    downstream connections. It is intended for manual use during flow development.</p>

<p>The intent of this processor is to provide a simple means to debug flow behavior at runtime, allowing for manual add,
    view, modify, and delete of individual FlowFiles in a running flow. It is not intended to run in a fully automated
    flow, but it can be useful during flow development to modify attributes or content, to route FlowFiles in a custom
    order.</p>

<h2>Accept Incoming FlowFile</h2>
<p>This processor may be used as the outgoing relationship destination of another processor. If so configured, it will
    accept FlowFiles for processing only upon manual intervention, via clicking the "Accept Incoming FlowFile" button on
    the processor home page.</p>
<p>The button increments an internal counter in the processor each time it is clicked. So, if two FlowFiles should be
    consumed by ProbeFlow from upstream processors, the button should be clicked two times.</p>
<p>Once added to the state of the running ProbeFlow processor, the FlowFile must be manually acted upon to remove it
    from the processor state. It may be cloned, dropped, or routed to any defined outgoing relationship, based on user
    action.</p>

<h2>Create New FlowFile</h2>
<p>This processor provides a simple interface to insert new FlowFiles into a running NiFi flow. Two modes are available
    to add new FlowFiles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>enter custom FlowFile text (useful for textual FlowFile content, such as JSON or XML)</li>
    <li>upload a custom FlowFile from a filesystem file (useful for binary FlowFile content, such as images or AVRO
        records)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Both the "FlowFile from text" and "FlowFile from file upload" web pages provide an interface to specify arbitrary
    FlowFile attributes.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To add a new attribute, specify the attribute name and value, and click the "Add" button.</li>
    <li>To remove an existing attribute, specify the attribute name, and click the "Delete" button.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enter Custom FlowFile (Text)</h3>
<p>The FlowFile content may be specified by entering text in the "Content" text area on the page.</p>

<h3>Upload Custom FlowFile (Filesystem File)</h3>
<p>The FlowFile content may be populated by uploading a file, using the "Choose File" button on the page. Once the file
    is selected, click the "Upload Content" button to populate the in progress FlowFile content.</p>

<h3>... Create New FlowFile</h3>
<p>Once the desired content and attributes are specified, the "Create FlowFile" button may be clicked to add the
    FlowFile to the processor state. When "Create FlowFile" is clicked, the editing state is preserved, so two
    identical FlowFiles may be created by clicking "Create FlowFile" twice.</p>

<p>To reset the content and attributes of the add screen, the "Reset FlowFile" button
    may be clicked. The reset action only affects the editing state of the in progress FlowFile.</p>

<h2>FlowFile Actions</h2>
<p>On the processor home page, the set of FlowFiles held by the processor are listed in a table.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To clone (make a copy of) a FlowFile in the list, click the CLONE button for the desired table row.</li>
    <li>To drop (delete) a FlowFile in the list, click the DROP button for the desired table row.</li>
    <li>To edit a copy of a FlowFile in the list, click the EDIT button for the desired table row.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FlowFile Editor</h2>
<p>The "Editor" web page provides a workspace to manipulate the attributes and content of a FlowFile. One FlowFile may
    be edited at a time. Clicking the "Create FlowFile" button will add a copy of the editor FlowFile to the processor
    state.</p>

<h2>Route FlowFile to Outgoing Relationship</h2>
<p>The processor property "Relationships" may be edited to define additional outgoing relationships for the processor,
    as a comma-separated list of relationship strings (e.g. "X,Y,Z"). By default, there is a single outgoing
    relationship (labeled "Outgoing").  Any FlowFile in the processor view "FlowFiles" table may be routed to any
    defined outgoing relationship at any time by clicking the desired "Route" button for the FlowFile.</p>
