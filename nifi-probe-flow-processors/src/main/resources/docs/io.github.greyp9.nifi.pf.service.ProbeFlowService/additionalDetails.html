<h1>ProbeFlow Service</h1>

<p>When running, this service provides a simple web interface at the port specified in the service properties (by
    default, port 18443). The <a href="https://localhost:18443">home page of the UI</a> provides access to the state
    of any active ProbeFlow processors. When not running, this service is inert; the specified port will not respond
    to incoming connections. This service must be enabled in order to start any dependent ProbeFlow processors.</p>

<p>An SSL Context Service must be defined in order enable ProbeFlow Service. The specified SSL context service is used
    to configure the ProbeFlow Service web interface, to provide TLS-secured client connections.</p>

<p>From the controller service home page, the following actions are available:</p>
<ul>
    <li>View the processor state for an active processor by clicking its processor id in the "Active Processors" list.
    </li>
    <li>Download / Upload processor state by clicking the up/down arrow icons in the "Active Processors" list.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the FlowFile editor for a processor by clicking the editor icon in the "Active Processors" list.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Download / Upload State</h2>
<p>From the "Processor State" view for a processor, options are available to download the held FlowFiles for the
    processor. This option allows test FlowFiles to be persisted to local filesystem of the user, to facilitate future
    reuse.</p>

<p>To Download the FlowFiles for a processor, right-click the "Download" link on the "Processor State" page, and select
    the "Save Link As..." option. (Browsers typically offer the opportunity to appropriately name the downloaded
    file.)</p>

<p>To Upload the FlowFiles from a previous ProbeFlow download, use the file selection interface on the "Processor
    State" page under the "Upload" header. Select the appropriate file from the web browser filesystem, and click the
    "Upload Content" button. The previously downloaded FlowFiles (attributes and content) are added to the processor
    state.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>
<p>See the documentation for ProbeFlow for additional information.</p>
